This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Brief

```bash
This project was mentored by the Youtuber Sonny Sangha. 
It is temporarily not available on iphone mobile devices due to the projects' tailwind CSS devices configuration. 
```

## What I have used in the project

- ðŸš©Use the Next.js to build up the whole project and know the structure and type definitions in typescript
- ðŸš©Use Tailwind CSS to build a silky modern personal portfolio website
- ðŸš©Use Framer Motion for a unique & breathtaking UI/UX experience 
- ðŸš©Use Sanity.io and its incredible CMS capabilities to power the backend, enabling to update the contents of the portfolio from anywhere in the world
- ðŸš©Deploy the portfolio to Vercel for the first time.
